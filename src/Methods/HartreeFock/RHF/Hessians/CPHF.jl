# CPHF (Coupled-Perturbed Hartree-Fock) orbital-response solver.

# two-electron contraction this needs, and it turns out to be exactly a

# build_fock! dispatches.
#
# Derivation: let ΔD_μν = sum_ai [C_μa U_ai C_νi + C_μi U_ai C_νa] (the
# symmetric AO-basis density built from the trial rotation U, shape
# (nvir,ndocc)), and ΔF_μν = 2*ΔD_rs*(μν|rs) - ΔD_rs*(μr|νs) -- exactly
# build_fock!'s two-electron contraction, with ΔD standing in for the density
# and no one-electron piece added. Expanding ΔD in terms of U and transforming
# ΔF to the MO occ-virt block:
#
#   sum_μν C_μa ΔF_μν C_νi
#     = 4*sum_bj U_bj*(ai|bj) - sum_bj U_bj*[(ab|ij) + (aj|ib)]
#     = sum_bj [4(ai|bj) - (ab|ij) - (aj|ib)] U_bj
#
# using (μν|jb)=(μν|bj) (AO ERI symmetry under the ket-pair swap) to combine
# the two Coulomb-shaped terms, and the same relabeling for the exchange
# piece -- exactly the CPHF coupling matrix's action on U. So:
# Cv'*ΔF*Co = A*U, with ΔF obtained by literally reusing build_fock!.

    build_response_fock!(ΔF, U, Co, Cv, ints)

Two-electron "response Fock" contraction used as the CPHF orbital-Hessian
matrix-vector product A*U. `U` is a trial occupied-virtual rotation, shape
`(nvir,ndocc)`; `Co`, `Cv` are the occupied/virtual blocks of the MO
coefficient matrix. Builds the symmetric trial AO density
`ΔD = Cv*U*Co' + Co*U'*Cv'`, then reuses `build_fock!`'s existing J/K
dispatch (Chonky/DF/SparseERI, whichever `ints` carries) with a zero
one-electron piece to get `ΔF` -- see this file's header for why that's
exactly the CPHF coupling matrix in disguise.

# The CPHF equation is (εa-εi)U_ai + (A·U)_ai = -B_ai. B has two pieces:
#
#   1. The "skeleton" Fock derivative: differentiate the AO integrals
#      directly (H, ERI) with the density D=Co*Co' held FIXED at its
#      converged value -- exactly the quantity RHFgrad.jl already builds one
#      contraction short of (it goes on to dot this against P,Q to get a
#      gradient; here it's kept as a full AO matrix and transformed to the
#      MO occ-virt block instead), minus ε_i*S_ai^(y) from the generalized
#      eigenvalue problem's metric.
#
#   2. A correction from how the occupied-occupied block of the MO
#      coefficient response is fixed (not solved for) by the orthonormality
#      constraint C(y)'S(y)C(y)=I: writing C_i^(y) = sum_p C_p U_pi, the
#      symmetric part of U is forced to U_pq+U_qp=-S_pq^(y) (MO-transformed

Coulomb- and exchange-shaped contractions of the *first*-derivative ERI

atom `iA`: `Jq[m,n] = sum_rs D[r,s]*d(mn|rs)/dA_q`, `Kq[m,n] = sum_rs
D[r,s]*d(mr|ns)/dA_q`. Returned as two `(nbas,nbas,3)` arrays.

Built directly from `GaussianBasis.∇sparseERI_2e4c`'s compressed
(permutation-unique) derivative list -- never materializes the dense
`(nbas,nbas,nbas,nbas,3)` derivative ERI tensor `∇ERI_2e4c!` would. For
each stored unique quartet, accumulates into `Jq`/`Kq` over the
(deduplicated) 8-member index-permutation orbit that shares its value;
validated against the dense `∇ERI_2e4c!`-based reference to machine

`ij_vals`/`σvals` are `∇sparseERI_2e4c`'s Schwarz screening bound
(`GaussianBasis.schwarz_bounds(bset)`), atom-independent -- callers looping
over every atom (this function is called once per atom, twice per atom
counting `cphf_rhs`'s own call inside `cphf_solve`) should compute it once

`∇kinetic!`/`∇nuclear!`/`∇overlap!`/`eri_grad_JK` pass (profiling on a real
24-atom molecule found this costing ~97s of the ~276s total CPHF time,
genuinely redundant work since `cphf_rhs` had already computed the exact
same quantities one call up the stack). Calling this instead of
`cphf_solve` and threading the extra return values through eliminates that
duplicate pass entirely.

Solves `(εa-εi)U + cphf_Amatvec(U) = -cphf_rhs(...)` via `KrylovKit.linsolve`
with CG (the orbital Hessian is symmetric positive definite at a true RHF
minimum), one right-hand side at a time -- but symmetrically
Jacobi-preconditioned by `d := sqrt.(εa-εi)` first: profiling found plain CG
here hitting `cphf_max_iter` (default 50) on ~85% of right-hand sides for a
real molecule, an operator-conditioning problem (the εa-εi denominators
span a huge range -- near-degenerate valence pairs to deep-core/high-virtual
gaps of tens of Hartree) rather than an algorithm bug. Since `M := Δeps.*x +
cphf_Amatvec(x)` is SPD and `Δeps` is diagonal (trivially invertible), the
standard fix (used by essentially every CPHF/TDDFT iterative solver,
including PySCF's Z-vector CPHF) is to solve the congruent, still-SPD
system `D^-1/2 M D^-1/2 y = D^-1/2 b` (`D:=Diagonal(vec(Δeps))`) instead --
substituting `x = y./d` throughout turns this into
`y .+ cphf_Amatvec(y./d)./d = -B./d` (elementwise `./d`, no need to
materialize `D` or its inverse), recovering `U = y./d` at the end.
