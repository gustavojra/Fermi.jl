# Two-electron (Coulomb + exchange) contribution to the RHF Hessian, contracted
# against a FIXED density matrix P -- i.e. the "integral response"/direct piece
# only (mirrors RHFgrad.jl's existing gradient formula one derivative order up;
# CPHF's density-*response* contribution, needing dP/dR, is a separate term
# assembled elsewhere). Never materializes the raw (nbas,nbas,nbas,nbas,3,3) ERI
# Hessian tensor -- contracts against P immediately, shell-quartet by
# shell-quartet, same spirit as a Fock build.
#
# GaussianBasis.jl's ∇2ERI_2e4c(bset,iA,iB,i,j,k,l) is the light-bridge
# shell-quartet Hessian primitive this contracts against -- the raw libcint
# kernel plumbing this file used to do directly (cint2e_ipip1/ipvip1/ip1ip2,
# with their non-obvious kernel-to-shell-pair mapping and reversed axis
# orientation for cross-shell kernels) now lives there instead, ported
# verbatim rather than touched, since getting that right the first time
# already needed careful cint_funcs.h reading and finite-difference checks.
#
# Visits only CANONICAL shell quadruples (i≤j, k≤l, (i,j)-pair ≥ (k,l)-pair --
# the same restriction RHFgrad.jl's outer loop uses), one `∇2ERI_2e4c` call
# each. Getting BOTH C1 and C2's full contribution (summed over all 8
# permutation-symmetric arrangements of that quadruple) from that SINGLE call
# needed its own derivation, verified against a brute-force reference (each
# of the 8 arrangements computed independently via its own permuted view of
# the canonical block, exactly as `RHFgrad.jl`'s own `quartet_contribution`
# derivation was verified) over 1000 random trials before trusting it:
#
#   C1 (Coulomb-shape, weight P[I,J]⊗P[K,L]) is IDENTICAL across all 8
#   arrangements -- same result RHFgrad.jl's Coulomb term found. So a
#   canonical quadruple's total C1 contribution is just `mult * Vcan_C1`,
#   `mult` being the count of distinct arrangements (1, 2, 4, or 8 depending
#   on i==j?/k==l?/(i,j)-pair==(k,l)-pair? degeneracies -- same combinatorics
#   as RHFgrad.jl's `quartet_contribution`).
#
#   C2 (exchange-shape, weight P[I,L]⊗P[K,J]) splits into exactly the same
#   "canonical-class"/"cross-class" (4-and-4, or fewer when degenerate)
#   pattern RHFgrad.jl's own exchange term did -- `half*Vcan_C2 +
#   half*Vcross_C2` in general, `Vcan_C2` alone (with the right multiplier)
#   when i==j and k==l simultaneously (bra-swap and ket-swap both become
#   no-ops, so there's no "cross" arrangement to distinguish).
#
# A pleasant side effect: since C1 and C2 now both derive from the SAME
# canonical block (i,j,k,l) -- not two independent calls, a genuinely
# different integral needing its own Schwarz bound, as an earlier version of
# this file had to handle -- one Schwarz screening decision (σ_ij·σ_kl) now
# correctly covers both terms.
#
# Three efficiency fixes found by profiling a real (24-atom caffeine, not a
# toy 3-atom molecule) system, none of which are visible at toy scale:
#
#   1. `σvals` is now an optional kwarg, computed once by RHFhess.jl's main
#      loop and threaded through, instead of every one of the O(natm^2)
#      ERI_hess_JK calls recomputing the same O(nshells^2) Schwarz bound
#      pass from scratch (RHFgrad.jl already avoided this; this file hadn't
#      been updated to match).
#
#   2. Atom membership is checked via a precomputed BitVector (`on_A`/`on_B`,
#      O(nshells), built once per call) instead of `any(p -> ...
#      shellval[p]].atom == Aat, 1:4)` -- a closure re-evaluated on every one
#      of the ~nshells^4/8 canonical quadruples. Profiling a single
#      ERI_hess_JK call on caffeine/sto-3g (52 shells, so ~950k canonical
#      quadruples to filter) showed this closure-based check alone consuming
#      ~26% of total samples -- more than either of the two real libcint
#      kernels it was gating. RHFgrad.jl's loop already used the cheaper
#      precomputed-array form; this file hadn't been brought in line with it.
#
#   3. Threaded via the same channel-based worker-pool pattern RHFgrad.jl
#      uses (and, originally, RHFHelper.jl's SparseERI build_fock!): work
#      items (surviving canonical quadruples) go into a bounded Channel,
#      each Threads.@spawn'd worker drains chunks into its own local (3,3)
#      accumulators, summed on the main task only after every worker
#      finishes. This file had no threading at all until now.

    ERI_hess_JK(bset::BasisSet, P::AbstractMatrix, iA::Int, iB::Int; σvals=nothing)

Two-electron Coulomb+exchange contribution to the RHF Hessian block (iA,iB),
`0.5*C1 - 0.25*C2` where `C1[x,y] = sum_mnrs P[m,n]*P[r,s]*d2(mn|rs)/dA_x dB_y`
(Coulomb-shape) and `C2[x,y] = sum_mnrs P[m,n]*P[r,s]*d2(ms|rn)/dA_x dB_y`
(exchange-shape) -- matching RHFgrad.jl's existing `0.5*P*P*ERI - 0.25*P*P*ERI`
gradient contraction one derivative order up. `P` is treated as fixed (the
converged SCF density); the CPHF density-response contribution is a separate
term. `σvals` is `GaussianBasis.schwarz_bounds(bset)`'s second return value --
atom-pair-independent, so callers looping over many `(iA,iB)` pairs (as
`RHFhess.jl`'s main loop does) should compute it once and pass it through
rather than paying its O(nshells^2) cost again on every call. See this file's
header comment for the canonical-quadruple/Schwarz/threading strategy.
